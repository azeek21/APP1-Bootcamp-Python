### Shit just go serious ...

# Testing
Hi, to test, 

1) Firs of all activate the virtual enviroment by doing ``` $ source venv/bin/activate ``` if you are on zsh. for other terminals you can google the respective activation order. 

2) Once you activated the venv, make sure to install the dependencies if you don't have them

``` $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` installs the necessary dependencies.

3) go into ```aaudio``` directory, make sure ```manage.py``` is available, or in other words, make sure you are in the correct folder.
Finally run ``` $ python3 manage.py runserver 8888 ``` and to go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 

You can enjoy the music, try uploading the audio (mp3) file inside the static directory. Feel free to upload audio file from tour computer and see how it handles.

Thanks.
